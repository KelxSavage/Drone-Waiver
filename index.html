DRONE RACING LIABILITY WAIVER & RELEASE

I understand that participation in drone racing involves small flying aircraft and carries risks including, but not limited to, minor injury, property damage, or equipment malfunction.

I voluntarily choose to participate (or allow my child to participate) in drone racing activities operated by Velocity Labs by Kel Savage.

I agree to follow all safety instructions and acknowledge that failure to do so may result in removal from the activity.

I release and hold harmless Velocity Labs, its operators, staff, volunteers, and event hosts from all liability, claims, or demands arising from participation, except in cases of gross negligence.

If I am signing on behalf of a minor, I certify that I am the parent or legal guardian and that I have the legal authority to sign this agreement.

By signing below, I acknowledge that I have read and agree to this waiver.
